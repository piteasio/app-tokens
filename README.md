# Notice:
Please keep in mind that not every token can be listed, and it will need to be approved by the Piteas team. Here are some basic requirements:
- The token must have at least $5K in major liquidity (LPs with liquid tokens)
- Liquidity pools must be integrated with Piteas
- The token's logo and details must be provided


# Disclaimer
After raising a PR, please allow us some time to verify the PR. We do not follow any particular order in reviewing token additions and updations.
